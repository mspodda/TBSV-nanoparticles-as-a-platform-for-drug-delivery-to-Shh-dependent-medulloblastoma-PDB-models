**Structures of the receptors**

The structures of the receptors – i.e. of human NRP-1 (PDB id: 5IYY, Mota et al., 2018) and human FABP3/H-FABP (PDB id: 5CE4, Howard et al., 2015) – were retreived from RCSB Protein Data Bank and used as starting coordinates for the docking calculations and simulations.

**Structures of the peptides**

The structures of tLyp1 (CGNKRTR) and CooP (CGLSGLGVA) peptides were taken from our previous work (Arcangeli et al., 2019[1]). 

**Structural models of the asymmetric unit of the cTBSV and cTBSV**

Modeller (Fiser and Sali, 2003) was used for generating the structural models of the asymmetric unit of the cTBSV in which at the C-terminal of each CP the tLyp1/CooP peptide was inserted by means of a GGPGG linker.

The template consisted of the atomic coordinates of TBSV (PDB id: 2TBV (A, B, C), Harrison et al., 1978; Olson et al., 1983). The calcium ions, which are known to play an important role in the stability of the viral particle, were also included during the construction of the models. The cTBSV models were then generated by expanding the asymmetric unit using the 60 transformation matrices provided by VIPERdb database tools (Carrillo-Tripp et al., 2009; http://viperdb.scripps.edu). 

ClusPro protein-protein docking (Vajada et al., 2017; Kozakov et al., 2017; Kozakov et al., 2013[2]) and HADDOCK 2.2 (van Zundert et al., 2016[3]) were used to obtain the receptor-peptide and receptor-ligands complexes, respectively. As positive controls, tufstin (TKPR, a peptide known to bind NRP-1 receptor) and oleic acid (CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7COOH, C18H34O2, the natural ligand of FABP3/H-FABP receptor) were docked with their respective targets. In both docking methods standard protocols were used and an ensemble of ten poses was generated for each docking run.
